&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origins of anarchism as a political philosophy date back to the 17th century, when English philosopher William Godwin first proposed a form of political philosophy based on the idea of “non-domination”. Godwin argued that the only way to guarantee the freedom of individuals was through the absence of government and the absence of hierarchy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas of Godwin were further developed by other thinkers, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin. Proudhon claimed that the only way to ensure freedom was to abolish private property and ensure that the only form of government was one based on mutual agreement between all participants. This became known as “anarchist collectivism”. Bakunin, on the other hand, proposed a form of anarchism that rejected the idea of government altogether and instead proposed a society based on free and voluntary associations of individuals and groups. This form of anarchism became known as “libertarian socialism”.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas of early philosophers such as Godwin, Proudhon have been further developed in the 19th and 20th centuries by other anarchist writers such as Emma Goldman, Peter Kropotkin and Noam Chomsky. But here we will mostly focus on Peter Kropotkin.
